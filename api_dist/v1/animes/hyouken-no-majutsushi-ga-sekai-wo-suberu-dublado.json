  "synopsis": "As the first commoner to attend the prestigious Arnold Academy of Sorcery, Ray White is immediately met with contempt from some of the students hailing from nobility. Unbeknownst to them, Ray's real identity is that of the famous Iceblade Sorcerer—a hero who led the country to victory in a past war and is one of the seven strongest sorcerers alive. Despite his legendary status, Ray wants nothing more than to live out the ordinary school life he never had.\n\nRay quickly makes friends with some of the most influential students thanks to his kind and amiable nature. Unfortunately, as those with nefarious motives begin to make their move, Ray may soon have no choice but to use his true power to preserve the bonds that make his new life worthwhile.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
