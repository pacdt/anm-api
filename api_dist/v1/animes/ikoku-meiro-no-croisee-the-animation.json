  "synopsis": "In 19th century Paris, Claude Claudel and his grandfather Oscar run a metalworking shop tucked away in the Galerie du Roy shopping arcade. Back home from his recent travels, Oscar appears with a young Japanese girl—Yune—by his side. Although he is initially against it, Claude comes to accept Oscar's announcement that Yune will live and work with them going forward.\n\nBewildered by Yune's foreign customs, Claude must balance looking after her and managing the shop. But over time, as she settles into her new role as a live-in maid, Claude slowly shows interest in learning to understand Yune and the vastly different world she comes from.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
