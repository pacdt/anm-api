  "synopsis": "At the age of 15, Hana Tabata has already made peace with the idea of never experiencing an unforgettable high school romance. Although she likes shoujo manga, flowers, and anything cute, Tabata considers herself a mere background character; she is a little bit chubby, with a round face, glasses, and freckles—all things that would make her conventionally unattractive. But when Tabata accidentally befriends Yousuke Ueno, a warm and charming classmate, things start to change. While she grapples with conflicting feelings about her unexpected new relationship with Ueno, Tabata has yet to realize that the love story she has been dreaming of has already begun.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
