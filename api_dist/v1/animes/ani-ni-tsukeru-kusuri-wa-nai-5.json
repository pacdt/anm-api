  "synopsis": "The Shi siblings have a lot on their plates, such as needing to stay frugal, passing their exams, and constantly dealing with each others' antics. Older brother Fen's frivolous demeanor often gets on his younger sister Miao's nerves, leading to physical but comedic altercations. Fortunately, their friends are always around to offer a helping hand.\n\nKai Xin is Fen's well-meaning best friend who rivals Fen's absentmindedness but makes up for it with his athleticism. Miao, on the other hand, is often accompanied by her bubbly companion Miaomiao. The most recent addition to the group is Wan Sui, who is desperate to conceal his wealth but remains tirelessly loyal to his peers—sometimes roping his younger brother Xing into their excursions.\n\nSometimes, the friends' roundabout means of problem-solving backfire. However, no predicament is going to prevent them from discovering how fun high school life can be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
