  "synopsis": "Following the events of their trip to Okinawa, Saitama University graduate students Shinya Yukimura and Ayame Himuro have failed to obtain the data necessary to scientifically prove their love for each other. Unable to replicate the exact conditions of the trip, the two stubborn scientists decide to seek help from elsewhere in the university—the Biological Sciences department.\n\nAssisted by fellow graduate students and longtime couple Chris Floret and Suiu Fujiwara, Yukimura and Himuro begin to quantify their feelings by measuring their output of oxytocin in various romantic situations. The two scientists soon find that their feelings for each other are nothing compared to that of a mature couple. It is here that Chris poses a question to both Yukimura and Himuro: what will they do if their \"affection\" is proven not to be love after all?\n\nDesperate to find a scientific rationale for the discrepancy, Yukimura puts everything on the line to prove that their \"love\" is real.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
