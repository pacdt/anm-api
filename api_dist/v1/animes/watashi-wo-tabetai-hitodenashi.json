  "synopsis": "After an accident sent her family to their deaths in the ocean, Hinako Yaotose keeps returning to the thought of sinking forever into the sea herself. With Miko Yashiro as her only friend, Hinako manages to keep up a semi-happy facade, but whenever Miko leaves her side, she slips into despair. Everything changes one summer when she meets a mysterious girl with eyes as deep and clear as the sea, drawing Hinako in like nothing else has in a long time.\n\nDuring her absent-minded search for the girl, Hinako is suddenly pulled underwater by a beastly deep-sea creature, only to awaken to the presence of the girl—Shiori Oumi—who takes on a monstrous form and kills Hinako's attacker. Despite this heroic act, Shiori's intentions are no different from any other monster's: she wants to eat Hinako.\n\nThe following morning, Shiori walks into Hinako's class as a transfer student, and Hinako cannot help but smile—at last, someone who could fulfill her quiet wish for death has appeared before her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
