  "synopsis": "Years ago, Lilith Kishimoto was orphaned when angry villagers murdered her parents. Now a strong-willed teenager, Lilith has inherited the mysterious Great Sword Calbrinus as well as a mission—to conceive a child with the heir to the Romuald lineage so that one day the Strigoi, Romanian vampires, can rise again. However, the man she must copulate with is Shinta Mizumura, an ordinary Japanese high school student completely unaware of the legacy he carries. While Shinta struggles with his feelings, Lilith strives to accomplish her goal by any means necessary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
