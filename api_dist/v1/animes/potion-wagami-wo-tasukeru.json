  "synopsis": "Kaede Yakumo, an ordinary 17-year-old high school girl, unexpectedly wakes up in another world with only her backpack alongside her. After aimlessly wandering around trying to understand her whereabouts, Kaede gives up and decides to look for anything useful in her belongings, which leads her to discover an unfamiliar book. Inside, the book lists recipes for producing potions using a simple command word, \"create,\" and a note telling her to think of this new experience as a game.\n\nWith a clear path laid out in front of her, Kaede vows to use the potions she crafts for her survival—and hopefully find the person who unfairly transported her to this world in order to return home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
