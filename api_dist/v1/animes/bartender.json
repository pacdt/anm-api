However, not just anyone can find Eden Hall; rather, it is Eden Hall that must find those who need it. Customers of varying backgrounds, each plagued with their own troubles, wander into this bar. Nevertheless, Ryuu always knows the ideal cocktail to console and guide each distraught soul.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
