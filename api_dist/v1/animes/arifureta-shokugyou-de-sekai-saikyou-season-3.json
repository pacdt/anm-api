  "synopsis": "En route to conquer a Great Labyrinth with his allies and former classmates, Hajime Nagumo is sidetracked by a tragedy that befalls his party member Shea Haulia. After encountering a group of rabbitmen caught in an ambush, Nagumo learns that members of Shea's Haulia Tribe have been abducted by soldiers of the Hoelscher Empire. To alleviate the anxiety of Shea, whose father may be in mortal danger, Nagumo decides to head toward the empire and rescue the missing Haulias.\n\nAfter arriving at his destination, Hajime is caught up in political turmoil between the empire and the Heiligh Kingdom. As princess Liliana S. B. Heiligh tries to formalize an alliance with the empire to protect her weakened kingdom against demon attacks, the Haulia Tribe plans to assassinate Emperor Gahard D. Hoelscher to free all rabbitmen from the empire's threat. Determined to protect his allies at any cost, Hajime will need to ignore all political considerations and unleash his unstoppable power on anyone who may stand in his way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
