  "synopsis": "The desperate battle in Kamihama City continues to intensify. With Walpurgis Night changing course for Mitakihara City, all eyes shift toward Embryo Eve—an artificial being, currently dormant, that can allegedly liberate magical girls from their destinies. As the Wings of Magius grow dangerously close to executing their plan, Iroha Tamaki's last chance to stop the organization is quickly fading. Despite the dwindling odds, lingering hope for the dawn of a better future invigorates her final endeavor, while also uncovering memories of a story tampered with by the hands of fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
