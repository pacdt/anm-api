  "synopsis": "In Japan, betting on horse racing is one of the few legal forms of gambling; thus, the public races have become an interesting part of Japanese culture. In this sport, an individual who rides a horse and competes in races is called a jockey—that is just what Yuu Arimura aspires to be.\n\nBecoming inspired after witnessing a derby, 15-year-old idol Yuu shocks the entire nation when he leaves the entertainment industry to enroll in a prestigious horse racing school. Excited to pursue his latest passion, he gradually bonds with his new classmates—such as the talented Shun Kazanami and the self-assured Amane Grace—who are each unique in their own way. Although the path ahead may be full of obstacles, Yuu is determined to pursue his ultimate goal of becoming one with his horse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
