  "synopsis": "Lü Shu is a frail teenager with an iron will. After losing his parents, he enrolls in a prestigious high school while working for a living and looking after his adoptive sister, Lü Xiaoyu. However, Lü Shu's quiet life abruptly changes when a car accident awakens his latent cultivation superpowers. Now cured of his physical weakness, he decides to hide his newfound abilities, as the art of cultivation is still shrouded in mystery—and the fate of cultivators uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile, Tian Luo Di Wang, the international foundation responsible for monitoring the cultivators, sets its plans in motion. Under the impetus of their member Xi Fei, a special cultivation training group is established in Lü Shu's high school. Although Lü Shu is forced to join the program, he is determined to hide the nature of his fearsome power, for his cultivation draws from an unlimited resource: the negative emotions of others brought about by his actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
