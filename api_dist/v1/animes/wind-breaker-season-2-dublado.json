  "synopsis": "Ever since Haruka Sakura joined Furin High School, where its students call themselves Bofurin and protect the town of Makochi, he has gained new friends despite his initial skepticism. Now starting to learn how to fight alongside his classmates and slowly growing out of his solitary past, Sakura has become the grade captain of the first-years.\n\nSakura's skills are put to the test when he and his classmates are faced with KEEL—a delinquent group known for its ruthless violence and coercion. While KEEL seems to be another rowdy group at first glance, their sudden appearance and strength in numbers might just be hiding a greater evil behind it. With all the odds against the Bofurin members, Sakura must accept that recognizing his shortcomings and receiving help from his upperclassmen will be necessary to preserve the peace in Makochi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
