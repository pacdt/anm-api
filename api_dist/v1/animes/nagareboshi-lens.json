Although she longs to experience this herself, it seems futile without romantic prospects of her own. However, a chance encounter lands her in the sights of Touga Yuugure, a popular boy in her school. Charmed by each other, Risa and Touga quickly become a couple, but it remains unclear whether a relationship between a plain girl and a well-liked boy can last.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
