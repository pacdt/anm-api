Armed with the world's most powerful supercomputer implanted in his left eye, the detective sets out to locate the missing boy. But as the case becomes more complex, Gokuu is forced to question whether it is possible to save Ryuu or if he will have to kill him before he fully transforms.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
