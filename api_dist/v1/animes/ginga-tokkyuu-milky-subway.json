  "synopsis": "Arrested for reckless space driving, super human Chiharu and cyborg Makina are sentenced to clean the Milky☆Subway—an old interplanetary train.\n\nEasy enough, right? Wrong. When the train suddenly takes off, they are thrown into a high-speed space-train spectacle packed with chaos, no plans, and zero strategy.\n\nJust pure momentum!\n\n(Source: Official website, translated)",
