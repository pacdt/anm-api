  "synopsis": "After falling asleep while playing an online game, a man wakes up and finds himself transported to that game's world as his in-game character, Arc. He wastes no time adjusting to his new environment, but soon realizes that he is using the skeleton avatar he chose when creating his character, which forces him to hide his visage to avoid unwanted attention.\n\nArc goes to the nearby castle town of Luvierte, hoping to become an adventurer and take on quests to earn money. With his overpowered abilities, Arc embarks on a fantastical journey—exploring diverse territories, looting various monsters, and helping people get out of sticky situations. However, his seemingly innocuous actions may soon involve him in a brewing large-scale conflict that will forever alter the fate of the realm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
