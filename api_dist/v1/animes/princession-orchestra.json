  "synopsis": "Alicepia Channel is a video sharing website exclusively for girls to share their singing, makeup, and dancing. Unbeknownst to others, users of the platform can travel to Alicepia, a secret world where time passes more slowly than reality. For Minamo Sorano and her best friend Natsu Hinoshita, Alicipia allows them to watch the idol Kagari Shirube live.\n\nHowever, the upbeat atmosphere is ruined when monsters called Jamaocks attack Shirube's concert venue, causing panic in the audience. Only princesses whose hearts are filled with song can save Alicepia from the Jamaocks, and Minamo will find herself among the brave defenders of this wonderland.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
