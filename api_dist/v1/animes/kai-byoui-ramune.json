  "synopsis": "At first glance, Ramune may not seem like a professional doctor—he is crass, rude, and often acts halfheartedly. But his true brilliance shines through once his patients pay him a visit: he is able to diagnose and treat all sorts of strange, mysterious diseases that come his way. From a young student whose fingers have turned into chili peppers to a child whose tears are made of condiments, Ramune is able to tap into a kind of innate, otherworldly sensibility that enables him to decipher the roots of their source. But finding the proper cure for these illnesses comes at a valuable price, and money certainly cannot be used to pay it. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
