  "synopsis": "Violence, name-calling, and humiliation are a daily reality for high school student Park Hyung Suk. Chubby and insecure, he is often used as a plaything and punching bag for bullies, which leads him to wish he could just disappear. Unexpectedly, when he transfers schools in the hopes of starting anew, a miraculous opportunity emerges: he awakens in a tall, handsome, and strangely athletic body. Hyung Suk quickly realizes that he is now the owner of two disparate bodies; when one falls asleep, he wakes up in the other.\n\nFeeling like he has won the lottery of life, Hyung Suk enters his new school as this attractive and strong young man. However, it soon becomes evident that being a popular student is not all smooth sailing. From girls wanting him only for his good looks to delinquents picking fights out of jealousy, he can never seem to escape trouble. In trying to balance his two different lives, Hyung Suk may find both of them to be sources of ceaseless challenges.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
