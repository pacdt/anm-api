Shortly after, Okabe abandons his mad scientist persona and becomes a seemingly regular university student. \n\nOkabe's close friend Mayuri Shiina perceives him to be recovering from his trauma and is visibly happy. However, something still seems to be bothering Okabe. Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero marks the beginning of a critical divergence—a timeline in which the burden of fate escalates beyond one's limits.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
