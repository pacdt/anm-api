  "synopsis": "Arriving late for her first day working at the Bokuto Police Department, the hotheaded Natsumi Tsujimoto feels uneasy about working with her new partner, the comparatively stiff Miyuki Kobayakawa. However, after learning that underneath Miyuki's rule-following exterior is a savvy mechanic who is extremely skilled behind the wheel of her heavily modified patrol car, Natsumi finds that her partner may be exactly what she needs.\n\nFrom apprehending reckless street racers to protecting their community, the two young women serve their city with tremendous energy and form a bond that extends far beyond their workplace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
