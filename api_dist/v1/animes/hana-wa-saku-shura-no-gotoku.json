  "synopsis": "Since childhood, Hana Haruyama has been enthralled by the art of storytelling. After watching a child her age perform on television with mesmerizing grace, Hana decides to try it herself. She practices by reciting tales to Tonaki Island's children, who are always enthusiastic about her performances. However, growing up in such a small community, Hana remains unaware of the possibilities beyond her world, satisfied with how things are.\n\nEntering Sumomogaoka High School as a first-year student, Hana catches the attention of Mizuki Usurai, the president of the broadcasting club, with her skills. Despite Hana's hesitation and anxiety about the road ahead, Mizuki successfully convinces her to join the club, nurture her gift, and perhaps one day reach the top—the nationals of the NHK Broadcasting Competition.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
