  "synopsis": "After the intense quarterfinals, the U-17 World Cup competition has been whittled down to four formidable teams. Standing between Team Japan's quest for international glory is the nine-time tournament champion, Germany, and their star-studded team, pro player Jurgen Borisovich Volk at its helm. With both the momentum and the crowd's favor on the side of their opponents, Japan faces an uphill battle.\n\nDetermined to avenge an earlier loss, Japan sends seven of their best—including team captain Houou Byoudouin—to challenge the German national team. But trying to reach the finals for the first time in Japan's tennis history may cause even these fearless players to crumble under mounting waves of pressure as they venture into uncharted territories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
