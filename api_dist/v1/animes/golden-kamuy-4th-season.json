  "synopsis": "The race to obtain the lost Ainu gold is nearing its peak, as even more formidable ex-prisoners are set on keeping their tattooed skins intact. Saichi \"The Immortal\" Sugimoto and Asirpa can finally move forward together, but Asirpa's time with Kiroranke and Ogata Hyakunosuke has slightly altered her ambition and strengthened her determination. As their party leaves the Russian territory, they gain a peculiar follower.\n\nMeanwhile, Toshizou Hijikata's crew makes major moves to get invaluable skins, falling into the poisonous trap of a dangerous convict. Although each group possesses a strong advantage over the others, even First Lieutenant Tokushirou Tsurumi—the most powerful and ruthless contender—cannot advance without Asirpa's help. However, his ominous plans for when they will inevitably meet remain a mystery.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
