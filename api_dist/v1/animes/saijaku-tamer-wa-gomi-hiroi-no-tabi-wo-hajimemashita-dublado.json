  "synopsis": "Born into a loving family, Femicia appears to have a bright future ahead of her. When she finally turns five, the time comes to go to the church to have her skills appraised. However, while she does receive a monster tamer skill, it turns out that Femicia has zero stars for that ability. To make matters worse, society considers those who have zero stars to be harbingers of misfortune; as a result, Femicia is shunned by everyone—including her family.\n\nSoon enough, Femicia is chased out of her village and is constantly on the run. Fearing for her life, she decides to masquerade as a boy and change her name to Ivy. With a goal given to her by a fortune teller to reach the royal capital, Ivy meets and successfully tames a slime, starting an unlikely friendship that may provide a means to get the destiny she deserves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
