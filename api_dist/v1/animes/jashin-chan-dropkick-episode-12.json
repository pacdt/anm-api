  "synopsis": "Making her grand return from space, Jashin-chan still seeks to kill Yurine Hanazono to get back into Hell. However, the attempted murder is put on hold when Yurine drags her out to the beach alongside the rest of her friends. Wasting valuable planning time, Jashin-chan instead finds herself spending the day doing what her summoner and her good friends do: swimming in the ocean, eating shaved ice, fighting a Kraken, and having a barbecue.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
