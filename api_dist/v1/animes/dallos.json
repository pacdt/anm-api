  "synopsis": "There was a time when life on Earth ran out of resources due to overpopulation. As a result, colonists were sent to the Moon, where they had to do dangerous and challenging mining jobs. Their efforts paid well, as the people of Earth now prosper from the Moon's bounty—but the colonists' lives are still riddled with terror.\n\nWhen an extremist group kidnaps Melinda Hearst, the girlfriend of a government official, tensions on the Moon reach a critical point. Third-generation colonist Shun Nonomura struggles to decide whether to lay low or join the rebellion. However, in the distance looms Dallos, a mysterious structure that could change the course of Lunar history.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
