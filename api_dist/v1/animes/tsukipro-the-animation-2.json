  "synopsis": "For the members of SolidS, Growth, SOARA, and QUELL, the Tsukino Talent Productions' Live 2021 Summer Carnival is coming soon. The two-day event will culminate with a joint live performance featuring all four units. Due to the size and setup of the stage, each unit will need to create new songs and choreographies to accompany them in the riveting second season of Tsukipro The Animation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
